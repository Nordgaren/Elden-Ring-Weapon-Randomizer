# Elden-Ring-Weapon-Randomizer
Weapon Randomizer for Elden Ring

## How to use

Elden Ring has anticheat, so you will need to disable it using your preferred method. This mod also edits memory that could be recorded by the games internal anticheat. I would recommend you backup your saves and restore them before going back online. If you're paranoid like I am, block the game from accessing the internet, too. :)

## Disable EAC

Make a text file called `steam_appid.txt` in your Game directory with the number `1245620` inside. Launch the game from the .exe, and you won't have EAC running anymore.

## Backup Saves
This path `%appdata%/EldenRing` should have your steam ID in it. Select the folder with the right steam ID and backup the `ER0000.sl2` in there. Note: The games backup is not sufficient. It will be contstantly overwritten by the game. Make it something different, like `ER0000.sl2.clean`
